// Touch (#286). A finger pans what it lands on - the page, the editor's
// text, a side panel's list - and a flick carries on, slowing to a stop.
// A tap clicks; a second tap selects the word, as a double-click does. A
// press held still selects the word and extends it word by word as the
// finger moves; where it lifts, the context menu opens. Touches on the tab
// strip, menus, dialogs, overlays and scrollbars keep Windows' own mouse
// emulation, and the mouse and the pen are unchanged.

// WM_POINTERDOWN, UPDATE, UP and CAPTURECHANGED: true when the touch is
// taken here, and DefWindowProc must not turn it into mouse input
